I'm currently working as a postdoctoral researcher under Prof. Linda Broadbelt in the
Chemical and Biological Engineering Department at Northwestern University. My research is
focused on the modelling of catalytic processes involved in the chemical recycling of plastics
using Density Functional Theory (DFT) and population balance models. 

I received my bachelor's in chemical engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology
(formerly, UDCT) in Mumbai. Following my period of undergraduate study, I proceeded to
Purdue University in the United States to pursue a doctorate in chemical engineering under
the guidance of Prof. Jeffrey Greeley. My doctoral thesis focused on the study and design
of high-entropy alloy catalysts for thermal and electrocatalytic applications, such as fuel cells,
using computational methods, including DFT and deep learning.

I'm interested in the applications of computational modelling and machine learning towards
the solution of problems in the sustainable generation of energy and production of fuels and
chemicals. I am also interested in technical writing and science communication, and to that end,
I have written several articles in the Medium publication *Towards Data Science* on 
mathematical modeling, chemical engineering, physics, and programming over the past six years.
